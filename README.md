# NSL_NodejsWorkshop
Node.js

This was a workshop in which we learned some basics of Node.js, and then built an instant messaging app.
Taught by Jack at NSL, (ie NSL is a hackerspace of which I am a member).
You can also see the finished output in some png files I included.
Also included the html and .js files used, which require npm modules.
